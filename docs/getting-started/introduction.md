# Introduction

**Project Mission:** To create an institutional-grade crypto trading platform that combines human-guided strategy with AI-powered analysis and execution.

This project is built on the philosophy of a **"Mutual Build Map"**, where the documentation serves as a shared contract between the human developer (the Architect) and the AI development partner (the Builder).

### The Core Roles

*   **The Architect (You):** Responsible for high-level strategy, infrastructure, security, and final deployment. You define *what* to build and *why*.
*   **The Builder (AI Partner - Gemini Build):** Responsible for executing the plan. It writes the code for UI components, API endpoints, and business logic based on the clear specifications laid out in this documentation.

This "Docs-Driven AI Development" workflow allows for rapid iteration, high-quality code, and a clear, shared understanding of the entire system.

Every new feature begins its life here, in the documentation, before a single line of code is written by the AI.
